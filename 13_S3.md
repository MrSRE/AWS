# Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

## Key Features of S3
- **Durability & Availability:** 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability.
- **Scalability:** Can handle unlimited storage.
- **Data Security:** Supports encryption, IAM policies, and bucket policies.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Automates data transitions between storage classes.
- **Versioning:** Maintains multiple versions of an object.
- **Event Notifications:** Triggers AWS Lambda, SNS, or SQS on changes.

## S3 Storage Classes
1. **S3 Standard** – High durability, low latency, frequently accessed data.
2. **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** – Moves objects automatically between frequent and infrequent tiers.
3. **S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)** – Lower cost for less frequently accessed data.
4. **S3 One Zone-IA** – Lower cost for infrequently accessed data in a single AZ.
5. **S3 Glacier** – Used for archival storage with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours.
6. **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** – Lowest-cost storage for long-term archival.

## S3 Bucket Operations
### 1. Create a Bucket
```sh
aws s3 mb s3://my-bucket
```

### 2. List Buckets
```sh
aws s3 ls
```

### 3. Upload an Object
```sh
aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://my-bucket/
```

### 4. Download an Object
```sh
aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket/myfile.txt ./
```

### 5. Delete an Object
```sh
aws s3 rm s3://my-bucket/myfile.txt
```

### 6. Delete a Bucket
```sh
aws s3 rb s3://my-bucket --force
```

## IAM Policies for S3
Example policy for granting full access to a specific bucket:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## S3 Interview Questions & Answers
### Basic Questions
1. **What is S3 in AWS?**
   - Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides scalable storage for data.

2. **What are the different S3 storage classes?**
   - S3 Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, Glacier, Glacier Deep Archive.

3. **How is data protected in S3?**
   - Data is protected using encryption, access control policies, and versioning.

4. **How does S3 pricing work?**
   - Pricing is based on storage used, requests, data transfer, and retrieval costs.

### Scenario-Based Questions
1. **How would you ensure secure access to an S3 bucket?**
   - Implement IAM policies, bucket policies, and enable encryption.

2. **What happens if you enable versioning on an S3 bucket?**
   - S3 keeps multiple versions of an object, preventing accidental deletions.

3. **How do you move old objects to Glacier storage?**
   - Use S3 Lifecycle Policies to transition objects automatically.

4. **Your company needs to store logs that should be immutable. How do you achieve this with S3?**
   - Use **S3 Object Lock** in Compliance mode to prevent modifications and deletions.

5. **You need to restrict public access to an S3 bucket while allowing access to a specific AWS service. What should you do?**
   - Use an S3 bucket policy that denies all public access and explicitly allows the required AWS service through an IAM policy.

6. **How can you optimize the cost of serving large media files from S3?**
   - Use **Amazon CloudFront** as a content delivery network (CDN) to cache and deliver files efficiently, reducing direct S3 access.

7. **A user accidentally deleted a critical file from S3. How can you recover it?**
   - If versioning is enabled, restore a previous version of the file.
   - If versioning is not enabled, consider using S3 Lifecycle rules to store backups.

8. **How can you enforce encryption for all objects uploaded to an S3 bucket?**
   - Configure a bucket policy to deny unencrypted uploads using `s3:PutObject` with `s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption` condition.

## Best Practices
- Enable **bucket versioning** for data protection.
- Use **server-side encryption** (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C) for sensitive data.
- Implement **least privilege** IAM policies.
- Use **S3 Transfer Acceleration** for faster uploads.
- Enable **S3 Object Lock** for compliance and data retention.
