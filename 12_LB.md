# Load Balancers and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) in AWS

AWS provides **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** to automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones.

## Types of AWS Load Balancers
1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
   - Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
   - Routes traffic based on request attributes (e.g., host, path, headers)
   - Ideal for microservices and containerized applications

2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**
   - Operates at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
   - Designed for ultra-high performance and low latency
   - Best suited for real-time applications like gaming or VoIP

3. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB) [Legacy]**
   - Operates at both Layer 4 and Layer 7
   - Suitable for basic load balancing needs
   - Recommended to use ALB or NLB instead

4. **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**
   - Designed for third-party virtual appliances (firewalls, IDS/IPS)
   - Uses the GENEVE protocol for traffic encapsulation

## Key Features of ELB
- **High Availability & Fault Tolerance:** Spans multiple Availability Zones.
- **Auto Scaling Integration:** Works seamlessly with EC2 Auto Scaling groups.
- **SSL Termination:** Offloads SSL/TLS encryption to improve performance.
- **Health Checks:** Monitors target instances and routes traffic only to healthy ones.
- **Sticky Sessions:** Supports session persistence based on cookies.
- **Access Logs & Monitoring:** Integrates with CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs, and AWS WAF.

## Setting Up a Load Balancer
### 1. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
```sh
aws elbv2 create-load-balancer \
    --name my-alb \
    --subnets subnet-abc123 subnet-def456 \
    --security-groups sg-xyz789 \
    --scheme internet-facing \
    --type application
```

### 2. Create a Target Group
```sh
aws elbv2 create-target-group \
    --name my-targets \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 80 \
    --vpc-id vpc-12345678
```

### 3. Register EC2 Instances with the Target Group
```sh
aws elbv2 register-targets \
    --target-group-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:account-id:targetgroup/my-targets/1234567890abcdef \
    --targets Id=i-1234567890abcdef0 Id=i-abcdef0123456789
```

### 4. Create a Listener and Attach Target Group
```sh
aws elbv2 create-listener \
    --load-balancer-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:account-id:loadbalancer/app/my-alb/1234567890abcdef \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 80 \
    --default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:account-id:targetgroup/my-targets/1234567890abcdef
```

## Load Balancer vs. Auto Scaling
| Feature         | Load Balancer | Auto Scaling |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Traffic Distribution | Yes | No |
| Health Checks | Yes | Yes |
| Automatic Scaling | No | Yes |
| Cost Reduction | Indirect | Yes |

## Interview Questions and Answers
### Basic Questions
1. **What is Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) in AWS?**
   - ELB automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

2. **What are the types of AWS Load Balancers?**
   - Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB), Classic Load Balancer (CLB), and Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB).

3. **What is the difference between ALB and NLB?**
   - ALB operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS), whereas NLB operates at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) and provides ultra-low latency performance.

4. **How does an ALB route traffic?**
   - ALB routes traffic based on request attributes like host, path, headers, and query parameters.

### Scenario-Based Questions
1. **Your ALB is not distributing traffic evenly. What could be the reason?**
   - Possible reasons:
     - Some instances might be failing health checks.
     - Sticky sessions (session persistence) might be enabled.
     - Traffic patterns may not be uniform.

2. **How do you handle an EC2 instance failure behind an ELB?**
   - ELB automatically detects unhealthy instances using health checks and stops sending traffic to them while directing traffic to healthy instances.

3. **You need to route API requests to different backend services based on request paths. Which AWS Load Balancer should you use?**
   - Application Load Balancer (ALB) because it supports path-based routing.

4. **Can you use an ELB with an on-premises data center?**
   - Yes, with AWS Outposts or by using AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic efficiently.

## Best Practices
- Use **ALB** for HTTP/HTTPS traffic and **NLB** for high-performance TCP/UDP applications.
- Enable **access logs** for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Configure **sticky sessions** only if required.
- Use **health checks** to ensure traffic is sent only to healthy instances.
- Implement **auto scaling** to dynamically adjust capacity behind the ELB.
- Secure applications using **AWS WAF** with ALB.
