# Security Groups in AWS

A **Security Group (SG)** in AWS acts as a virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances and other AWS resources.

## Features of Security Groups
- **Stateful**: If you allow inbound traffic, the outbound response is automatically allowed.
- **Instance-Level Control**: Security Groups operate at the instance level, not at the subnet level.
- **Supports Allow Rules Only**: Unlike NACLs, Security Groups do not support deny rules.
- **Rules are Evaluated as a Whole**: If any rule allows the traffic, it is permitted.
- **Default Deny Policy**: By default, all inbound traffic is denied, and all outbound traffic is allowed.

## Default Security Group Behavior
- **Inbound Rules**: Deny all incoming traffic by default.
- **Outbound Rules**: Allow all outgoing traffic by default.

## How Security Groups Work
1. Assign a security group to an instance at launch or modify it later.
2. Define inbound and outbound rules specifying protocols, ports, and allowed sources/destinations.
3. AWS evaluates the rules dynamically when traffic reaches the instance.
4. Multiple security groups can be associated with a single instance.

## Creating and Managing Security Groups
### 1. Create a Security Group
```sh
aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name my-security-group --description "My security group" --vpc-id vpc-12345678
```

### 2. Add Inbound Rules (Allow SSH and HTTP)
```sh
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-12345678 --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-12345678 --protocol tcp --port 80 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

### 3. Add Outbound Rules
```sh
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-egress --group-id sg-12345678 --protocol all --port all --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

### 4. List Security Groups
```sh
aws ec2 describe-security-groups
```

### 5. Delete a Security Group
```sh
aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-id sg-12345678
```

## Security Group vs. Network ACL
| Feature           | Security Group | Network ACL |
|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Level of Control | Instance-level | Subnet-level |
| Stateful?        | Yes | No |
| Default Rules    | Allow all outbound, deny all inbound | Allow all inbound and outbound |
| Supports Deny?   | No | Yes |
| Evaluated As?    | A whole set of rules | Rules are evaluated sequentially |

## Interview Questions and Answers
### Basic Questions
1. **What is a Security Group?**
   - A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for AWS resources.

2. **Are Security Groups stateful or stateless?**
   - Security Groups are stateful, meaning an allowed inbound request automatically allows the response outbound.

3. **Can a Security Group block specific IPs?**
   - No, Security Groups only allow rules. To block specific IPs, use Network ACLs.

4. **How many Security Groups can be attached to an instance?**
   - You can attach up to **five** Security Groups to an EC2 instance.

5. **What happens if no Security Group is assigned to an instance?**
   - It gets assigned the default Security Group, which denies all inbound traffic but allows outbound traffic.

### Scenario-Based Questions
1. **Your EC2 instance cannot be accessed via SSH. What could be wrong?**
   - The security group might not have an inbound rule allowing port 22 (SSH).

2. **How do you restrict access to an EC2 instance to only a specific IP?**
   - Modify the security group to allow inbound traffic only from the desired IP using CIDR notation.

3. **Can a Security Group be assigned to multiple instances?**
   - Yes, a Security Group can be associated with multiple instances within the same VPC.

4. **How do you ensure only a private subnet’s instances can access a database?**
   - Create a security group for the database that allows inbound traffic only from the private subnet’s security group.

5. **How do you block a specific range of IPs from accessing an instance?**
   - Security Groups do not support deny rules. Use Network ACLs for blocking specific IPs.

## Best Practices
- Follow the **least privilege principle** – only allow necessary traffic.
- Use **separate Security Groups** for different types of workloads.
- Regularly **audit Security Group rules** to remove unnecessary ones.
- Implement **VPC Flow Logs** to monitor traffic patterns.
- Use **Security Groups referencing other Security Groups** instead of CIDR-based rules for better flexibility.
